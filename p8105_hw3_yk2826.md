Homework 3
================

Problem 1
---------

load and clean the BRFSS data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010)

brfss_data = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, location = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = 
                             c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Answer the following questions:

a.In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(location)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, n_location == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ## # Groups:   year [1]
    ##    year state n_location
    ##   <int> <chr>      <int>
    ## 1  2002 CT             7
    ## 2  2002 FL             7
    ## 3  2002 NC             7

From the result, we can see in 2002, CT, FL and NC were observed at 7 locations.

b.Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(location)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_location, color = state)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    labs(
      title = "Number of locations plot",
      x = "Year",
      y = "The number of locations in each state"
    ) +
  scale_color_hue(
    name = "State",
    h = c(100, 350),
    l = 75
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

I used "geom\_line()" to make the "spaghetti plot" to show the trends in the number of locations across 50 states and the District of Columbia over years. The x axis shows the year from 2002 to 2010, and the y axis shows the number of locations in each state in each year. States are differentiated by different colors. The number of locations did not change much over years in most states except Florida. Florida had more than 40 locations in year 2007 and 2010, while the number of locations in all states in other years were less than 20.

c.Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2002,2006,2010),
         state == "NY", response == "Excellent") %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_excellent = sd(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

|  year|  mean\_excellent|  sd\_excellent|
|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
|  2002|             24.0|            4.5|
|  2006|             22.5|            4.0|
|  2010|             22.7|            3.6|

The table shows the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010. We can see, the proportion of “Excellent” responses was highest in 2002, then slightly declined from 2002 to 2006, and were approximately equal in 2006 and 2010. The standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State declined from 2002 to 2010, which means there were less variability with respect to the proportion of “Excellent” responses in years 2006 and 2010 than in year 2002 maybe because the number of observations increased.

d.For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

``` r
response_average = 
  brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, state, response) %>%
  summarize(average = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) 
response_average
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,215 x 4
    ## # Groups:   year, state [?]
    ##     year state response  average
    ##    <int> <chr> <fct>       <dbl>
    ##  1  2002 AK    Excellent    27.9
    ##  2  2002 AK    Very good    33.7
    ##  3  2002 AK    Good         23.8
    ##  4  2002 AK    Fair          8.6
    ##  5  2002 AK    Poor          5.9
    ##  6  2002 AL    Excellent    18.5
    ##  7  2002 AL    Very good    30.9
    ##  8  2002 AL    Good         32.7
    ##  9  2002 AL    Fair         12.1
    ## 10  2002 AL    Poor          5.9
    ## # ... with 2,205 more rows

``` r
response_average %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average, color = state)) + 
     geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(~response) + 
    labs(
      title = "State-level averages vs year",
      x = "Year",
      y = "State-level averages")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yk2826_files/figure-markdown_github/response_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

I used line plots because they are the most appropriate to show the trends of distribution of the average proportion in each state over time. We can see from the plots that for all states the state-level average proportions in "Very good" were the highest while the state-level average proportions in "Poor" were the lowest from 2002 to 2010. Besides, the distributions of these state-level averages for each category remains relatively constant over years, which implies that responses did not vary apparently over time.
