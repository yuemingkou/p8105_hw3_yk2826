---------

load and clean the BRFSS data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010)

brfss_data = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, location = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = 
                             c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Answer the following questions:

a.In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(location)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, n_location == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ## # Groups:   year [1]
    ##    year state n_location
    ##   <int> <chr>      <int>
    ## 1  2002 CT             7
    ## 2  2002 FL             7
